* Added an autoenum.py script i use in CTFs,might add more functions like nikto in it later  

#### 15/7/2024 1:54 AM

* Made a keylogger that hides itself in the background and logs keystrokes. (works on both linux and windows)

#### 18/7/2024 2:03 AM

* made a wifi hacking script in python. It lets you capture and attempt to crack wpa handshakes.

hope someone can find these scripts useful :)

P.S. I am not responsible for any legal trouble caused by you hacking or abusing these scripts.
