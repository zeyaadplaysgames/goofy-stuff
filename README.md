- remade the whole autoenum.py script into autenum.sh, made it easier to use and update, as well as added different features in it like nikto and enum4linux.

- made a cool calculator that does basic conversion of units, allows you to freely run your own operations and run basic trigonometric calculations :D
- i did this mostly to automate doing homework lol
- will be less updates as im back to school
hope someone can find these scripts useful :)

P.S. I am not responsible for any legal trouble caused by you hacking or abusing these scripts.  
PLEASE PLEASE be responsible and ethical when hacking. Only hack things/people you have permission to hack. thanks :)
